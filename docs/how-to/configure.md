## Config Structure

### Mandatory Sections

Lighter uses YAML configs to define experiments. A typical config is organized into two mandatory sections:

*   **`trainer`**: Configures [`Trainer` (PyTorch Lightning)](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html).
*   **`system`**: Defines [`System` (Lighter)](../../reference/system/#lighter.system.System) that encapsulates components such as model, criterion, optimizer, or dataloaders.

Here's a minimal example illustrating the basic structure:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
trainer:
    _target_: pytorch_lightning.Trainer
    max_epochs: 10

system:
    _target_: lighter.System

    model:
        _target_: torch.nn.Linear
        in_features: 100
        out_features: 10

    criterion:
        _target_: torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss

    optimizer:
        _target_: torch.optim.Adam
        params: "$@system#model.parameters()"
        lr: 0.001

    dataloaders:
        train:
            _target_: torch.utils.data.DataLoader
            batch_size: 32
            shuffle: True
            dataset:
                _target_: torch.utils.data.TensorDataset
                tensors:
                    - _target_: torch.randn
                      size: [1000, 100]
                    - _target_: torch.randint
                      low: 0
                      high: 10
                      size: [1000]
```

In this example, we define a simple linear model, a cross-entropy loss, and an Adam optimizer. The `dataloaders` section sets up a basic training dataloader using random tensors.


### Optional Sections

In addition to mandatory `trainer` and `system` sections, you can include the following optional sections: 

*   **`_requires_`**: Evaluated before the rest of the config. Useful for importing modules used by Python expressions in the config as explained in [Evaluating Python Expressions](#evaluating-python-expressions).
*   **`project`**: Path to your project directory. Used to import custom modules. For more details, see [Custom Project Modules](../how-to/project_module.md).
*   **`vars`**: Store variables for use in other parts of the config. Useful to avoid repetition and easily update values. See [Referencing Other Components](#referencing-other-components).
*   **`args`**: Arguments to pass to the the stage of the experiment being run.


#### Defining `args`

Lighter operates in *stages*: `fit`, `validate`, `test`, and `predict`. We will cover these in the [Run](run.md) guide in detail.

To pass arguments to a stage, use the `args` section in in your config. For example, to set the `ckpt_path` argument of the `fit` stage/method in your config:

```yaml
args:
    fit:
        ckpt_path: "path/to/checkpoint.ckpt"

# ... Rest of the config
```

or pass/override it from the command line:

```bash
lighter fit experiment.yaml --args#fit#ckpt_path="path/to/checkpoint.ckpt"
```

The equivalent of this in Python would be:

```python
Trainer.fit(model, ckpt_path="path/to/checkpoint.ckpt")
```

where `model` is an instance of `System` defined in the `experiment.yaml`.

## Config Syntax

Lighter relies on [MONAI Bundle configuration system](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/config_syntax.html) to define and instantiate its components in a clear, modular fashion. This system allows you to separate your code from configuration details by specifying classes, functions, and their initialization parameters in YAML.

### Instantiating a Class

To create an instance of a class, use the `_target_` key with the fully qualified name of the class, and list its constructor arguments as key-value pairs. This approach is used for all configurable Lighter components (models, datasets, transforms, optimizers, etc.).

Example:

```yaml hl_lines="2"
model:
    _target_: torchvision.models.resnet18
    pretrained: False
    num_classes: 10
```

Here, `_target_: torchvision.models.resnet18` directs Lighter to instantiate the `resnet18` model from the `torchvision.models` module using `pretrained` and `num_classes` as constructor arguments. This is equivalent to `torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=False, num_classes=10)` in Python.

### Referencing Other Components

Referencing can be achieved either using `%` or `@`.

- `%` textually replaces the reference with the YAML value that it points to.

- `@` replaces the reference with the Python evaluated value that it points to.

To understand the difference, consider the following example:

```yaml hl_lines="4 8"
system:
# ...
    metrics:
        train:
            - _target_: torchmetrics.classification.AUROC
              task: binary
        # Or use relative referencing "%#train" for the same effect 
        val: "%system#metrics#train" # (1)!
```

1.  Reference to the same definition as `train`, not the same instance.

In this example, `val: "%system#metrics#train"` creates a new instance of `torchmetrics.classification.AUROC` metric with the same definition as the referenced `train` metric. This is because `%` is a textual reference, and the reference is replaced with the YAML value it points to. If we used `@` instead of `%`, both `train` and `val` would point to the same instance of `AUROC`, which is not the desired behavior.

On the other hand, when defining a scheduler, we want to reference the instantiated optimizer. In this case, we use `@`:
```yaml hl_lines="5"
system:
# ...
    scheduler:
        _target_: torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR
        optimizer: "@system#optimizer" # (1)!
        step_size: 1
```

1.  Reference to the instantiated optimizer.

### Evaluating Python Expressions

Sometimes, you may need to evaluate Python expressions in your config. To indicate that, use `$` before the expression.
For example, we can dinamically define the `min_lr` of a `scheduler` to a fraction of `optimizer#lr`:

```yaml hl_lines="6"
system:
# ...
    scheduler:
        _target_: torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau
        optimizer: "@system#optimizer"
        end_lr: "$@system#optimizer#lr * 0.1" # (1)!
```

1.  `$` denotes that the expression should be run as Python code.


**Note:** you will regularly use the combination of evaluation and referencing to pass `model.parameters()` to your optimizer:

```yaml hl_lines="3"
optimizer:
    _target_: torch.optim.Adam
    params: "$@system#model.parameters()" # (1)!
    lr: 0.001
```

1. It first fetches the evaluated `"system#model"`, and then runs `.parameters()` on it, as indicated by the `"$"` prefix.

!!! note "Difference between `#` and `.`"

    Use `#` to reference elements of the config, and `.` to access attributes/methods of Python objects. For example, `"$@system#model.parameters()"` fetches the model instance from `@system#model` and runs `.parameters()` on it as indicated by `$`.


### Overriding Config from CLI

Any parameter in the config can be overridden from the command line. Consider the following config:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
trainer:
    max_epochs: 10
    callbacks:
        - _target_: pytorch_lightning.callbacks.EarlyStopping
          monitor: val_acc
        - _target_: pytorch_lightning.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint
          monitor: val_acc
# ...
```

To change `max_epochs` in `trainer` from `10` to `20`:

```bash
lighter fit config.yaml --trainer#max_epochs=20
```

To override an element of a list, simply specify its index:

```bash
lighter fit config.yaml --trainer#callbacks#1#monitor="val_loss"
```

### Merging Configs

You can merge multiple configs by combining them with `,`:

```bash
lighter fit config1.yaml,config2.yaml
```

This will merge the two configs, with the second config overriding any conflicting parameters from the first one.

## Recap and Next Steps

This section covered the fundamental aspects of configuring experiments with Lighter using YAML files.  Key takeaways include:

*   **Structure:** Lighter configs are structured into mandatory `trainer` and `system` sections, with optional sections like `_requires_`, `vars`, `args`, and `project`.
*   **Stages:** Lighter operates in stages (e.g., `fit`, `validate`, `test`), each configurable via the `args` section.
*   **Config Syntax:** Lighter leverages the MONAI Bundle configuration system, using `_target_` to instantiate classes and key-value pairs for arguments.
*   **Referencing:** Components can be referenced using `%` (textual replacement) or `@` (evaluated Python value).  Understanding the difference is crucial for correct instantiation and interaction of components.
*   **Python Expressions:** Python expressions can be evaluated within the config using `$`. This is frequently used in conjunction with referencing (e.g., `"$@system#model.parameters()"`).
*   **CLI Overrides:** Any config parameter can be overridden from the command line, providing flexibility for experimentation.
*   **Config Merging:** Multiple configs can be merged using commas, allowing for modularity and reuse.

By mastering these configuration basics, you can effectively define and manage your Lighter experiments.

Next, we will look at the different Lighter stages and how to [Run](run.md) them.
